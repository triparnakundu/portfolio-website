# Blog images

Add your post photos here. Use these names for the sample posts, or add new images and update the paths in `index.html`.

- **post-1.jpg** — Featured image for "Welcome to my blog"
- **post-2.jpg** — Featured image for "Starting the new year in Boston"

You can use `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png`. Update the `src` in the corresponding blog card and blog post in `index.html` if you use different filenames.

To add a new post:
1. Add a new `.blog-card` in the `.blog-grid` (link to `#blog-post-X`).
2. Add a new `#blog-post-X` article in `.blog-posts` with your text and images.
3. Add your photos to this folder and reference them in the new post.
